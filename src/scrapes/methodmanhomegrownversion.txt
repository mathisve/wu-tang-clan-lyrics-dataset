Hey, you, get off my cloud
You don't know me and you don't know my style
Who be gettin flam when they come to a jam?

Patty cake patty cake hey the method man

The master of the plan wrappin shit like Saran

Uhh, Uhh
Rappers crossing over to that R&B jinx
Walk around town like your shit don't stink
Take it from me, hey G, you don't amaze me
Shot me at point blank range but only grazed me
Nothing mental, just plain and simple
Lyrics you bust couldn't bust a fucking pimple
Come here kid, what, let me tell you something
Your like change of a penny, nothing
Wham, Oh shit, God Damn
Skippy, hit me, man I get flam
Better yet hectic, wreck shit, I'm rowdy
Like a license check this be Audi
Tippy tippy tum tippy tah tippy tum
Direct from the Shaolin Slum, here I come
Straight from the top, the cock, yo I'm fed up
I put it in your ear and fuck your whole head up
Wu-Tang's gang bang, up your butt crack and
Straight from Staten, silky like satin
Used to break clicks with stones and sticks
Nowadays we do it with the Macs and clips
The Method, Man

The Method, Man
Yes I am, Yes I am

[Movie samples from "Willie Dynamite"]
Man we always been loose
Dealin off the turf like it was never gonna run dry
That ain't no business
No other game is run so disorganized
Look around
Everything that is taken care of business
is together, dig it? TIGHT!!
(Together, except us)
[whispered] Right!!
